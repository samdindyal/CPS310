#CPS310 (Computer Organization II)
##Lab 2

###Part A

The programs written for Part A of this lab are M68000 Assembler programs which involve I/O and arithmetic manipulations using trap sequences. In an attempt to make this lab a little bit more of a challenge I have decided to use subroutines which pass their values through the stack. Each of the programs written for this part backup and restore all data and address registers before and after executing the required subroutines respectively.
