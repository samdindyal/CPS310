##Lab 4

Lab 4 consists of an M68000 program which reads in a binary file of numbers, stores it into an array of signed integers and sorts it with a variable searching algorithm. For this lab, I have used bubble sort. The code I have written first creates a file from a hardcoded, unsorted array of signed integers of long size then reads them in and sorts them. Once it has completed sorting them it writes them out to the same file.
