#CPS310 (Computer Organization II)
##Lab 5

Lab 5 is an M68000 program which takes in a sorted array of signed integers. It then takes in a user input from the keyboard as a search key and uses binary search to print an ASCII string dependent on if the element was, or was not, found in the array. 

***Note*** 

This lab assignment is a continuation of the previous assignment, lab 4, that is, the input file has been generated from the program written in lab 4.
